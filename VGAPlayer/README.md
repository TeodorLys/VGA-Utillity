# VGA Player

This video player let you have two videos playing at the same time, on top of one another, and being able to play/pause at the same time.

## Current state

The player is in SUPER early production, all you can do basically is: pause/play, enable fullscreen, and choose which movies to play.

But the underlying base is almost complete, there are some scaling stuff that need to be fixed but, its getting there.
